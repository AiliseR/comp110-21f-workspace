    "### I, personally, am not a COMP major- I'm PSYC actually. I originally wanted to test how many PSYC and NSCI majors were in the class, but I was having issues with my code and went with this hypothesis instead. Nevertheless, I'm surprised at just how many non-majors are in the class, and I think this knowledge could be used to inform teaching style and content. \n",
    "\n",
    "### For example, giving examples that demonstrate the usefullness of these skills in other contexts (for example, statistical analysis in psychology), could really help connect non-majors to the course material. Of course, this coruse is already taught in this style, so I guess keep up the good work!"
